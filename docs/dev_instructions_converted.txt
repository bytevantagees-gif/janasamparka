Copilot prompt — backend scaffold (paste into Copilot Chat):
You are an expert FastAPI developer. Scaffold a FastAPI project in /backend/app with:
- main.py (FastAPI app)
- database.py (SQLAlchemy engine + session)
- models.py with SQLAlchemy models: User, Ward, Department, Complaint, Media, StatusLog
- pydantic schemas.py for request/response
- routers: auth.py (OTP mock + JWT), complaints.py (create/list/detail), departments.py, wards.py
- Dockerfile and requirements.txt
- A minimal pytest test for complaint creation.
Include comments, example env variables, and OpenAPI docs enabled.
Database — models & migrations
Use SQLAlchemy + Alembic. Use UUID primary keys and PostGIS geometry for wards.
Schema highlights:

	•	wards (id, name, taluk, geom Polygon)
	•	departments (id, name, contact_phone, contact_email)
	•	complaints (id, user_id, title, description, lat, lng, ward_id, dept_id, status enum, priority, created_at, updated_at)
	•	media (id, complaint_id, url, media_type, uploaded_at, lat, lng)
	•	status_logs (id, complaint_id, old_status, new_status, changed_by, note, timestamp)
Copilot prompt — DB models & Alembic:
Create SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migration scripts for User, Ward (geom), Department, Complaint, Media, and StatusLog. Add example seed data for Puttur wards and an alembic revision for initial schema.
Flutter app — skeleton
Screens:
	•	LoginScreen (OTP)
	•	HomeScreen (cards: Submit Complaint, Track, Polls, News)
	•	SubmitComplaintScreen (photo, voice button, GPS)
	•	ComplaintListScreen
	•	ComplaintDetailScreen
Localization: use flutter_localizations + intl, store translations in ARB/JSON for en and kn. Keep i18n keys in lib/l10n/.
State management: Riverpod or Provider suggested.
Copilot prompt — Flutter skeleton:
Scaffold a Flutter app in /frontend/flutter_app with localization (en + kn), main.dart, and example screens: LoginScreen, HomeScreen, SubmitComplaintScreen, ComplaintListScreen, ComplaintDetailScreen. Use Riverpod for state, and add an ApiService class demonstrating how to call backend endpoints.
React admin dashboard — skeleton
Pages: Login, Complaints List, Complaint Detail, Departments List
Copilot prompt — React scaffold:
Create a React admin dashboard scaffold in /admin-dashboard/web with JWT auth, an Axios client, a complaints list page with filters (ward, status), a complaint detail page with assign-to-department action. Use Material-UI and include a Jest test for the complaints list component.

Phase 1 — testing & quality checks
Backend tests (pytest):
	•	Test OTP request/verify flows (mock)
	•	Test complaint creation payload validation
	•	Test complaint listing & filtering
	•	Test assign-to-department logic
	•	Test media upload (mock storage)
Flutter tests:
	•	Widget tests for SubmitComplaintScreen (form validation)
	•	Integration test for complaint submission (simulate offline/online if possible)
React tests:
	•	Jest + React Testing Library for complaints list & detail
Coverage targets:
	•	Backend critical modules ≥ 70% coverage
	•	Frontend component coverage ≥ 60% for MVP

Phase 2 — maps, PostGIS & Bhoomi integration (high level)
Goals & endpoints:
	•	/geocode/ward?lat=&lng= → returns ward metadata (use PostGIS ST_Contains)
	•	/projects → returns geoJSON for projects/works
	•	Implement spatial indexes on wards (GIST index)
	•	Integrate Bhoomi API for land-record lookup; if official API isn't available, implement secure link-out to Bhoomi portal and instruct users
Copilot prompt — Ward geocode endpoint:
Add a /geocode/ward endpoint to FastAPI: accept lat & lng, query PostGIS wards polygon table and return the ward. Add unit tests for sample coordinates from Puttur.
Flutter prompt — Map screen:
Add a MapScreen using Mapbox in Flutter that fetches /projects geoJSON and displays pins. On pin tap, open a bottom sheet with project summary and "View Details".

Phase 3 — polls, news, Jana Mana (video) features
Backend endpoints:

Implement FastAPI routers for polls: Poll, PollOption, Vote models; endpoints to create/list/vote and result. Add test cases enforcing one vote per user per poll.

Phase 4 — AI, speech & analytics
Speech-to-text:
	•	Endpoint /speech/transcribe accepts audio blob, calls Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (language kn-IN), returns transcript + confidence. Include retry/fallback logic and safe rate-limiting.
Duplicate detection:
	•	Background job computes embeddings for complaints, stores them in vector store (FAISS or Weaviate), and endpoint /ai/duplicate-check returns top N similar complaints.
Weekly summary:
	•	Endpoint /ai/summarize?period=week produces a short report with top 10 issues, sentiment summary, and ward hotlist. Can email to MLA and be downloadable as PDF.
Copilot prompt — speech & duplicate-check:
Implement /speech/transcribe that accepts an audio file, sends it to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text with language kn-IN, and returns the transcript. Also scaffold a background job that ingests complaint texts into FAISS and exposes /ai/duplicate-check to return similar complaints for a given text + location.

Phase 5 — scaling, RBAC & optional blockchain
Harden security & operations:
	•	Role-based access control (roles: Citizen, Moderator, MLA, DepartmentOfficer, Auditor)
	•	Audit logs for all changes (status changes, assignments)
	•	Logging + monitoring (Sentry + Prometheus)
	•	Rate limits, input sanitization, virus scan for uploads (ClamAV)
	•	GDPR & Indian data protection compliance: store data in Indian region
Optional: immutable ledger (blockchain) write-up for critical actions (closure of projects, proof uploads) — used for audit trails.

API design (core endpoints snapshot)

	•	POST /complaints/{id}/status (change status + note)
Media
	•	POST /media/upload — multipart/form-data → returns { url }
Polls
	•	CRUD /polls, /polls/{id}/vote, /polls/{id}/results
Maps
	•	GET /geocode/ward?lat=&lng=
	•	GET /projects → returns geoJSON
AI

Ready-to-use Copilot Chat prompts (phase by phase)
Copy each prompt into Copilot Chat in VS Code. Keep prompts scoped and paste only one at a time. Edit paths if needed.
Phase 1
	•	Backend scaffold (use the block below)
You are an expert FastAPI developer. Scaffold a FastAPI project in /backend/app with:
- main.py, database.py (SQLAlchemy session), models.py (User, Complaint, Department, Ward, Media, StatusLog), schemas.py, routers (auth.py, complaints.py, departments.py, wards.py).
- Add JWT auth (access + refresh) and a mock OTP flow for citizens.
- Provide a Dockerfile, requirements.txt and a pytest test for complaint creation.
	•	DB models + Alembic
Generate SQLAlchemy models for User, Complaint, Department, Ward (with PostGIS geom), Media and create alembic migration script for initial schema. Add sample seed data for Puttur wards.
	•	Flutter skeleton
Scaffold a Flutter app in /frontend/flutter_app with localization (en + kn), main screens: LoginScreen, HomeScreen, SubmitComplaintScreen, ComplaintListScreen, ComplaintDetailScreen. Use Riverpod for state and add ApiService for backend calls. Include example widget test.
	•	React admin scaffold
Create a React admin in /admin-dashboard/web with JWT auth, ComplaintsList (filters), ComplaintDetail (assign to department), and Axios client. Use Material UI and include one Jest test.
Phase 2
	•	Ward geocode endpoint:
Add /geocode/ward endpoint to FastAPI that accepts lat and lng, queries PostGIS ward polygons, and returns ward info. Add unit tests for sample coords.
	•	Flutter Map screen:
Add a MapScreen in Flutter that fetches /projects (geoJSON) and displays pins; tapping a pin opens a bottom sheet with details.
Phase 3
	•	Polls:
Implement Poll, PollOption, Vote models and routers with endpoints: create/list/vote/results. Add tests that ensure one vote per verified user per poll.
	•	Jitsi booking:
Implement events endpoints and a simple Jitsi embed in Flutter. Provide server-side token generation instructions if using secure JWT for Jitsi.
Phase 4
	•	Speech transcribe:
Add /speech/transcribe endpoint: accepts audio file, calls Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (language kn-IN), returns transcript and confidence. Implement retry/fallback and tests.
	•	Duplicate detection:
Write a background job that computes embeddings for complaint texts (OpenAI or sentence-transformers), store in FAISS and expose /ai/duplicate-check to return similar complaints with scores.

QA & release checklist (before public pilot)
	•	All unit & integration tests pass; coverage goals met for critical modules
	•	Manual smoke testing: complaint lifecycle, assign, upload proof, closure
	•	App built as Android release and signed
	•	Kannada translations validated by native speaker
	•	Load test basic workflows (create many complaints, map queries)
	•	Basic security audit for endpoints & uploads

Are all of these included in the writeup?
Excellent catch ✅ — and you’re absolutely right.
The **previous version** of the concept had a much **broader citizen-oriented scope**, merging governance + guidance + growth — essentially turning it into a *comprehensive rural development & participation platform,* not just an MLA grievance app.

Let’s now merge **both versions** — the **earlier detailed citizen-first version** + the **structured governance version** — into a **final complete writeup** that includes **every single feature** and **expansion angle**.

---

# 📱 **ಜನಸಂಪರ್ಕ – Janasamparka (MLA Connect App)**

### *Empowering citizens. Enabling leaders. Enhancing governance.*

---

## 🧭 **1️⃣ Vision**

To build a bilingual (Kannada + English) **smart constituency ecosystem** that connects **citizens, MLAs, and government departments** for faster grievance resolution, data-driven governance, and transparent rural development.

This app becomes a **one-stop citizen companion** — providing:

* Governance (complaints, MLA connect, schemes)
* Guidance (self-help, documents, how-to guides)
* Growth (jobs, agriculture, training, welfare tracking)
